# About this `WhatNot` thing

File: `/docs/about.md`

This is a collection of unsorted writings accumilated as bits and pieces over (frankly, quite a long) time.
As such, the site is work in progress and will grow as I process the material and, hopefully, create something new.
Turns out the burden of accumulated old stuff is a heavy obstacle, on all levels of experience.

## Structure

At the moment, the categorization is ad-hoc and will probably change in the future. Live categories should be helped by `mkdocs` magic that maintains and presents severl types of ToCs (Table of Contents), on the right side of each page, as well as navigation hints on the left. Still learning the tools :-)
### HowTos
<!-- [HowTos](./howtos/index_howtos.md) -->
Here lives everything that records experiences in hope to be useful in the future or to facilitate learning or just to keep sanity when experience goes wrong and there's a need to backtrace.

### Writing
<!-- [Writing](./writing/index_writing.md) -->
Here I plan to have something more complete and digested, possibly shareable. For now, for inspiration and learning, just copied great stuff from elsewhere that I was going to read anyways.

### Reading
<!-- [Reading](./reading/index.md) -->
Just a place holder for now

### Blog
<!-- [Blog](./blog/index.md) -->
